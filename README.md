#### Please note that since I'm using a free platform, the initial database load may take around one minute. However, once it's loaded, the app should run seamlessly.

I just finished building a small fullstack app where I got to refresh my Java skills and try out MongoDB for the backend. On the frontend, I used React and Tailwind CSS to create the user interface.

My objectives for this project were to consolidate my knowledge of Java, explore MongoDB as a database solution, and consolidate my skills in React and Tailwind CSS.

Additionally, I wanted to deploy the fullstack app using a Dockerfile for the backend, which made the deployment process smooth and efficient.

Happy with the outcome and the valuable learning experience this project provided. Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts!
